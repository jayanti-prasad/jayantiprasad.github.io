    "About":"My name is Jayanti Prasad and I am a Physicist and data scientist. I did Ph.D in Physics with specialization in Astronomy & Astrophyics from the <a href=\"http://www.hri.res.in/\"> Harish-Chandra Research Institute Allhabad (India) </a> in 2009. I have worked on problems in cosmology (galaxy formation and clustering, N-body simulation, cosmic microwave background, early universe etc), Radio Astronomy and Gravational Waves. I was a post doctoral fellow at the National Centre for Astrophyics (NCRA-TIFR) Pune from 2008 to 2010 and at the Inter-University Center for Astronomy & Astrophysics (IUCAA) Pune from 2010-2013. I was a DST-SERB (Govt of India) Young scientist at IUCAA from 2013-2015. For a brief period of time from 2015 to 2016 I also worked at the Center for modeling and simulation department of the Savitribai Phule Pune University Pune. I joined at IUCAA again in 2016 as a Consulatant System Administrator for the LIGO project and resigned in 2018 to take a Full time job of a data scientist at a software company Accelere Software (now Emobold Technologies) in 2018.  I resigned from the Embold Technology in late 2019 to work on some Freelancing projects. I was one of the invited speakers of the \"Big Data 2020\" meeting which took place in Ancona (Italy) between 13th and 18th January 2020.",
